		<title>Discovering FreeIPA domains</title>
		<para><command>realmd</command> discovers which domains or
		realms it can use or configure. It can discover and identify
		FreeIPA domains by looking up the appropriate DNS SRV
		records and by connecting to the server and retrieving
		its TLS certificate.</para>

		<para>The following DNS SRV records are required to be present
		for <command>realmd</command> to identify a provided realm as
		an Kerberos domain.</para>

		<informalexample>
<screen>
# In this example the FreeIPA domain is 'domain.example.com'
<emphasis>_kerberos._udp.</emphasis>domain.example.com.
</screen>
		</informalexample>

		<para>In addition <command>realmd</command> connects to the first
		three KDC's listed and tests if they are FreeIPA servers. It
		does this by connecting via HTTPS and retrieving their certificate
		from the <filename>/ipa/config/ca.crt</filename> location. It
		compares this certificate with the one being used on KDC HTTPS
		server. If they match the domain is treated as a FreeIPA domain.</para>

		<para>To see how <command>realmd</command> is discovering a
		particular domain name, try a command like the following. Using
		the <option>--verbose</option> argument displays verbose
		discovery information.</para>

		<informalexample>
<screen>
$ <command>realm --verbose discover domain.example.com</command>
 * Searching for kerberos SRV records for domain: _kerberos._udp.ipa.thewalter.lan
 * Searching for MSDCS SRV records on domain: _kerberos._tcp.dc._msdcs.ipa.thewalter.lan
 * dc.domain.example.com:88
 * Trying to retrieve IPA certificate from dc.domain.example.com
 * Retrieved IPA CA certificate verifies the HTTPS connection
 * Found kerberos DNS records for: domain.example.com
 * Found IPA style certificate for: domain.example.com
 * Successfully discovered: domain.example.com
